# - Strutture Dati e Algoritmi - <br /> <i>Data Structures and Algorithms</i>

This is a collection of remarkable algorithms implementation in Python language, making use of Jupyter Notebooks. There are also some numerical examples of their usage, shown for particular data structures.

In the following table are summarized all the treated algorithms, grouped by performed task:

<table>
<tr><th>Task		                <th>Algorithm
<tr><td>Array sorting	            <td> <ul> <li>Insertion sort <li>Merge sort <ul>
<tr><td>Array maximum element seach <td> <ul> <li>Incremental approach <li>Divide et Impera approach <ul>
<tr><td>Matrix multiplication   	<td> <ul> <li>Incremental approach <li>Divide et Impera approach <li>Strassen algorithm <ul>
<tr><td>Ground state calculation    <td> <ul> <li>Matrix Product State (MPS) <li>Matrix Product Operator (MPO) <li>Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG)
</table>

The notebooks named with a 2 at the end show step by step the operations done by the algorithm.
